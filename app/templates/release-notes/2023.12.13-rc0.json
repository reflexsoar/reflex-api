For example consider the description of: `This is a test alert for {{ winlog.computer_name }}`, the value in the braces will be replaced with the value of the field `winlog.computer_name`.\n- Detection rules can now be edited directly from the Event Drawer of the event fired from the rule.\n- Users with the `sync_local_subscribers` permission can now force synchronize all Detection Repository subscribers from a single action, instead of having to wait for the sync interval or log into the tenant and force sync.\n- Detection Repository Subscriptions can now be edited without having to delete the subscription and resubscribe.\n"

This change will break any previous signature hashes that were created with a different field ordering.\n- Field Templates can now be assigned to Inputs, Detections will inherit the field templates from the input or merge with the input if there is a descrepancy. (Field Templates will be ignored when polling an input, will be changed in a future release).\n"

The public key can be retrieved by clicking Generate Public Key on any Private Key credential.  Private Key credentials default to `ECDSA` but `RSA` is supported.\n"
